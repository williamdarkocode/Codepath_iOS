## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Working with the UI based editor of XCode was quite new to me; usually any UI work I do is done prgramatically like in HTML, React, etc. The different panels on XCode also seems quite intimidating at first, especially since I barely know what all the buttons, and differnet views do; I'm used to using a simple editor like VS Code, or even simpler like VI.

However, Swift as a language doesn't look too foreign, so that was fairly easy to deal with.
